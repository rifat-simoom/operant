# Contributing to Operant

Thanks for helping improve Operant. This project is still evolving quickly, so
small, well-scoped pull requests are the easiest way to contribute.

## Before you start

- Read the [README](README.md) for the current product and setup overview
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Local setup

### Requirements

- Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`

## Quality checks

Run these before opening a pull request:

`npm run lint` includes both ESLint and TypeScript typechecking.

## Pull request guidelines

- Prefer focused PRs over large mixed changes
- Add or update tests when behavior changes
- Update docs when setup, workflows, or user-facing behavior changes
- Keep commits descriptive and easy to review
- If a change is large, open an issue first so we can align on direction

## Commit style

This repo prefers conventional-style commit messages:

```text
type(scope): short description
```

Examples:

- `feat(mcp): add pipeline question response tool`
- `fix(worktree): avoid deleting dirty merged branches`
- `docs(readme): clarify source install flow`

## What to include in a PR
